# React-Redux Directory Browser

Run the application with `npm run serve`

I chose 
 - React because I am already long time working with it.
 - Webpack because I am trying to get more familiar with it, it is allowing more options, settings than create React App
 - Redux because it is the state manager that I already used many times and in such a application it is necessary to have state management.
 - Material UI because I recently used it in other project and I found it nice
